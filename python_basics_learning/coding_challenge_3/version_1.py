Python OS module - provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS comes under Pythonâ€™s standard utility modules. This module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality.

with open
open() takes three 3 parameters
- filename
- mode
- encoding 

strip() - removes any leading and trailingwhitespace characters including new lines and spaces from the string letter, to make sure they key used in the dictionary does not include unwanted spaces that might affect the key lookup later
