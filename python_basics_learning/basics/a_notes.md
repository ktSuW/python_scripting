# Learning list

## May 
- Wed 1 - iterator expression, generator function, iterator class, list comprehension - generator expression in [], generator, yield 
    - [python built in function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next)
- Decorators
    - Thurs 2 - function aliasing, nested functions
    - Fri 3 - function as return value, function as argument, filter(function, list), map(), reduce(), basic decorator, decorator_1.py
- Sat 4 - pandas - reference to the function, lambda, 
    - driver (JDBC - Java), ODBC (Microsoft)
    - Download HR DB from MYSQL, setup db, import database (will have everything)or run DDL and dataload files 
- Mon 6 - install Docker Desktop, clickhouse local
- Tue 7 - Decorators more example, 
    - network topologies - 
    - network layout
    - Physical, Logical (how data flows from hosts to hosts) e.g. Bus topology, ring topology (logical layout no longer in use), star topology (hub and spoke), hybrid (star bus), mesh (mess topology - every hosts connects to all other hosts), creates fault tolerance
    - coaxial cable - inner conductor, insulator (sepearte inner and outer), outer conductor, PVC sheet, RG6, radiograde, determines thickeness and resistance in ohms, f-type connector - more common, BNC connector, twinazial/twinaz cable - two inner conductors
    - coaxial cable has two conductors: one center point and a tubular conducting layer
    - RG radiograde sepcifies thickness of conductors, insulation and shielding
    - RG-6 has a 75 OHM rating and is commonly used for cable networking, and uses a threated F-type connector
