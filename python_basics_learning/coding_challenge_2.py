Coding Challenge 2: Password Validator
Scenario: Write a Python program that acts as a password validator. The program should ask the user to input a password and check if it meets the following criteria:
Minimum length: 8 characters
At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
At least one digit (0-9)
At least one special character (~!@#$%^&*()_+-={}|[]\:;'<>,.?/)
Output:
If the password meets all criteria, print a message stating "Password is valid."
If the password fails any criteria, print a message stating "Password is invalid." and list the specific criteria that were not met.

Bonus:
Implement a password strength meter that assigns a score based on the number of criteria met and the length of the password.
Allow users to input the minimum password length and allowed special characters.
